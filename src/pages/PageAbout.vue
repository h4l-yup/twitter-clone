    <h4>About Twitter</h4>
    <div class="text-body1">
      Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on
      which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered
      users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only
      read them. Users access Twitter through its website interface or its
      mobile-device application software ("app"), though the service could also
      be accessed via SMS before April 2020. The service is provided by
      Twitter, Inc., a corporation based in San Francisco, California, and has
      more than 25 offices around the world. Tweets were originally
      restricted to 140 characters, but the limit was doubled to 280 for non-CJK
      languages in November 2017. Audio and video tweets remain limited to
      140 seconds for most accounts. Twitter was created by Jack Dorsey, Noah
      Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams in March 2006 and launched in July of
      that year. By 2012, more than 100 million users posted 340 million tweets
      a day, and the service handled an average of 1.6 billion search
      queries per day. In 2013, it was one of the ten most-visited
      websites and has been described as "the SMS of the Internet". As of Q1
      2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users. Twitter
      is a some-to-many microblogging service, given that the vast majority of
      tweets are written by a small minority of users.
